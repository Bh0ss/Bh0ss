### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my data science tool bag while focusing in sports data and machine learning modeling
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create an image clustering algorithm to group user uploaded images together based on skill
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any and all machine learning algorithms and understanding their complexity
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am open and freeminded to talk about anything in or outside the techonology realm
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me on Linkedin @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-hoss/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am someone who enjoys the outdoors just as much as I enjoy my computer based skills. I try to create a happy middle allowing myself time to downhill mountain bike, hike, kayak, surf and camp. I am outgoing and love talking tech or nature. Feel free to reach out with any questions or just to chat!
